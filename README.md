Configifier
===========


**WARNING NOT READY FOR USE YET.  JUST PUTTING IT OUT THERE TO HAVE A DISCUSSION.**


what's this, then?
------------------

- it's a tool to read your runtime config from config files, shell
  environment, and command line in a uniform, canonical, and flexible
  way.

- it is intended as an alternative for
  [Configurator](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/configurator),
  [optparse-applicative](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optparse-applicative),
  [cmdargs](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cmdargs).  (also
  note-worthy:
  [multiarg](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/multiarg),
  [yaml-config](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yaml-config),
  [getopt-generics](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/getopt-generics).
  [envy](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/envy)
  let me know what i've missed.)

- it is inspired by
  [servant](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant) in its use of
  ghc's type-level programming.

- it comes with an instructive example in `./examples/Main.hs`
